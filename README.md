# FLOAT

**Framework for Local Observation of Aquatic Tanks**

FLOAT is an Edge IoT system designed to monitor and control aquatic tanks using low-power embedded devices.
The system performs local monitoring, anomaly detection and actuator control without relying on cloud infrastructure.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how **edge devices can autonomously detect abnormal behaviors (e.g., pump stall)** and react in real-time while minimizing energy consumption.

# System Architecture

The system is composed of two ESP32 nodes communicating through **ESP-NOW**, a low-power connectionless wireless protocol.

### Target Node

The Target Node is responsible for:

• Simulating turbidity sensing
• Controlling the **water pump**
• Controlling the **feeding servo motor**
• Sending system logs and commands to the Observer Node

### Observer Node

The Observer Node performs monitoring and analysis:

• Measures current consumption using an **INA219 power sensor**
• Learns the normal behavior of the pump
• Detects anomalies using a **statistical 3-Sigma rule**
• Sends an **emergency HALT command** if abnormal current is detected

Communication between the nodes is implemented using **ESP-NOW**, allowing direct device-to-device communication without WiFi infrastructure.

# Edge AI Monitoring

The system implements a lightweight **statistical anomaly detection algorithm at the edge**.

During the **learning phase**, the Observer Node collects samples of the pump current consumption.

The following values are computed:

μ = mean current
σ = standard deviation

The anomaly threshold is then calculated as:

Threshold = μ + 3σ

If the current exceeds the threshold for **three consecutive samples**, the system identifies a **mechanical stall** and immediately stops the pump.

This approach enables **real-time fault detection without cloud processing**.

### Power Monitoring Reliability

Requirement

### Low Power Operation

Requirement
Maximize battery lifetime.

Metric

Duty Cycle:

# Communication

The system uses **ESP-NOW**, which offers:

• Connectionless communication
• Very low latency
• Low energy consumption

Two message types are exchanged between nodes:

LOG → status information
CMD → system commands (START_LEARN, START_MONITOR, STOP_MEASURE, HALT)

# Experiments

Several experiments were performed to validate the system behavior.

### Experiment 1 – Pump Current Learning

Goal
